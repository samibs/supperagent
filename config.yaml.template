# Configuration for the AgentOS Platform
# --------------------------------------
#
# To use this file:
# 1. Make a copy of it and name it `config.yaml`.
# 2. Fill in your actual API keys for the services you wish to use.
# 3. IMPORTANT: The `config.yaml` file is ignored by git to protect your secrets.

# --- API Keys ---
# You only need to provide a key for AT LEAST ONE of the services below.
# The platform will intelligently fall back to an available client if your
# preferred model's key is not provided.
# Fallback Priority: Anthropic -> Google -> OpenAI
api_keys:
  anthropic: "sk-ant-..."  # Your API key for Claude models
  google: "..."           # Your API key for Gemini models
  openai: "sk-..."          # Your API key for Codex/GPT models

# --- Model Selection ---
# Specify the exact model versions you want each agent family to use.
# These are just recommended examples; you can use any model available
# via your configured API key(s).
models:
  # Recommended for creative, planning, and documentation tasks.
  claude: "claude-3-haiku-20240307"

  # Recommended for analytical, logical reasoning, and code review tasks.
  gemini: "gemini-1.5-pro-latest"

  # Recommended for pure code generation tasks.
  codex: "gpt-4-turbo" # Using a modern equivalent for the "codex" role

# --- Long-Term Memory ---
# The long-term memory system uses a local vector database (ChromaDB) and
# a sentence-transformer model to store and retrieve learnings from past projects.
# WARNING: This requires significant RAM. If the application is killed unexpectedly,
# it is recommended to set `enabled` to `false`.
memory:
  enabled: true
